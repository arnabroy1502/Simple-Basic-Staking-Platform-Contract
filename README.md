# Simple-Basic-Staking-Platform-Contract# Simple Basic Staking Platform

## Project Description

The Simple Basic Staking Platform is a minimalist decentralized staking application built on the Stacks blockchain. This streamlined version focuses on the two core functionalities of any staking platform: **staking** and **unstaking** STX tokens. Users can stake their STX tokens and receive Staking Reward Tokens (SRT) in a 1:1 ratio, providing a simple and transparent staking mechanism.

### Key Features

- **Two Core Functions**: 
  - `stake()` - Stake STX tokens and receive SRT reward tokens
  - `unstake()` - Burn SRT tokens and withdraw staked STX

- **Simple Reward System**: 1:1 ratio between staked STX and reward tokens (SRT)
- **Transparent Tracking**: Real-time tracking of individual stakes and total platform staking
- **Immediate Liquidity**: Users receive tradeable SRT tokens representing their stake
- **No Lock Periods**: Instant unstaking capability for maximum flexibility

### Technical Specifications

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin Layer 2)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Reward Token**: SRT (Staking Reward Token) - SIP-010 compliant
- **Staking Ratio**: 1 STX = 1 SRT (1:1 conversion)
- **Contract Functions**: 2 core functions + 6 read-only helper functions
- **Security**: Built-in balance validation and error handling

### Contract Functions

#### Core Functions (2):
1. **`stake(amount)`** - Stakes specified amount of STX tokens
2. **`unstake(amount)`** - Unstakes specified amount and returns STX

#### Read-Only Functions (6):
- `get-stake-balance(account)` - Returns user's staked amount
- `get-reward-balance(account)` - Returns user's SRT token balance
- `get-total-staked()` - Returns total STX staked in platform
- `get-name()`, `get-symbol()`, `get-decimals()` - Token metadata
- `get-total-supply()` - Total SRT tokens in circulation

## Project Vision

Our vision for the Simple Basic Staking Platform is to provide:

### 1. **Accessibility First**
Create the most user-friendly entry point into DeFi staking on Stacks, removing complexity barriers that prevent newcomers from participating in decentralized finance.

### 2. **Transparency and Trust**
Build a platform where every transaction is transparent, every reward is calculable, and every user can verify their stake status at any time without hidden fees or complex mechanisms.

### 3. **Educational Foundation**
Serve as a learning platform for users new to staking concepts, providing a safe environment to understand how staking works before engaging with more complex DeFi protocols.

### 4. **Immediate Utility**
Provide instant liquidity through SRT tokens, allowing users to trade or use their staked position in other DeFi applications while maintaining their staking benefits.

### 5. **Community Building**
Foster a community of STX holders who actively participate in securing and growing the Stacks ecosystem through simplified staking mechanisms.
